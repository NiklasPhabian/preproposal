abstract = {Research programming is a type of programming activity where the goal is to write computer programs to obtain insights from data. Millions of professionals in elds ranging from science, engineering, business, nance, public policy, and journalism, as well as numerous students and computer hobbyists, all perform research programming on a daily basis. My thesis is that by understanding the unique challenges faced during research programming, it becomes possible to apply techniques from dynamic program analy-sis, mixed-initiative recommendation systems, and OS-level tracing to make research programmers more productive. This dissertation characterizes the research programming process, describes typi-cal challenges faced by research programmers, and presents ve software tools that I have developed to address some key challenges. 1.) Proactive Wrangler is an interac-tive graphical tool that helps research programmers reformat and clean data prior to analysis. 2.)IncPy is a Python interpreter that speeds up the data analysis scripting cycle and helps programmers manage code and data dependencies. 3.)SlopPy is a Python interpreter that automatically makes existing scripts error-tolerant, thereby also speeding up the data analysis scripting cycle. 4.)Burrito is a Linux-based system that helps programmers organize, annotate, and recall past insights about their experiments. 5.)CDE is a software packaging tool that makes it easy to deploy, archive, and share research code. Taken together, these ve tools enable re-search programmers to iterate and potentially discover insights faster by ooading the burdens of data management and provenance to the computer},

abstract = {The TerraServer stores aerial, satellite, and topographic images of the earth in a SQL database available via the Internet. It is the world's largest online atlas, combining five terabytes of image data from the United States Geological Survey (USGS) and SPIN-2. This report describes the system-redesign based on our experience over the last year. It also reports usage and operations results over the last year -- over 2 billion web hits and over 20 Terabytes of imagry served over the Internet. Internet browsers provide intuitive spatial and text interfaces to the data. Users need no special hardware, software, or knowledge to locate and browse imagery. This paper describes how terabytes of "Internet unfriendly" geo-spatial images were scrubbed and edited into hundreds of millions of "Internet friendly" image tiles and loaded into a SQL data warehouse. Microsoft TerraServer demonstrates that general-purpose relational database technology can manage large scale image repositories, and shows that web browsers can be a good geospatial image presentation system.},

abstract = {Earth System Science Server (ES3) is a suite of technologies for managing end-to-end science data product creation, maintenance, updating, and dissemination. ES3 has four main components: Metadata management keeps track of external data objects imported, processes run, data objects created, data products delivered, and lineage (ancestordescendent relationships between processes and data streams. Process management uses a generic Linux cluster to perform both science and production processing. Data management keeps all data online in mirrored server pairs, acquired “just-in-time” to leverage plummeting hardware costs. Data product dissemination exposes products via three mechanisms: wellknow URIs that follow community-standard naming schemes and support OpenDAP services; seamless layers in a precomputed hierarchy of resolutions, via the Microsoft TerraServer; and library-style searches using the Alexandria Digital Library web services. The ES3 prototype will manage the creation, updating and distribution of snow-covered area, snow albedo, and snow water equivalence data products.},
