abstract = {Hydrologic models increasingly require knowledge of the amount of snow cover within a pixel in order to provide accurate estimates of snow covered area. Present methods for remote sensing of subpixel snow cover require knowledge of the spectral reflectance properties of the snow as well as the background material, making these methods difficult to apply globally. Similar problems were encountered in global remote sensing of aerosol particles over varying land terrain. Since both aerosol and snow are dark at 2.1 mum, we suggest a method for sub-pixel snow mapping based on experience with remote sensing of aerosols. Here the pixel reflectance at 2.1 mum is used to estimate the reflectance of the non-snow regions in the pixel at 0.66 mum. The difference between the total pixel brightness at 0.66 mum and the derived brightness of the same pixel without the snow is used to estimate the sub-pixel snow cover with an error usually {\textless} {\&}PLUSMN;0.05.},

abstract = {Snow cover over the Northern Hemisphere plays a crucial role in the Earth's hydrology and surface energy balance, and modulates feedbacks that control variations of global climate. While many of these variations are associated with exchanges of energy and mass between the land surface and the atmosphere, other expected changes are likely to propagate downstream and affect oceanic processes in coastal zones. For example, a large component of the freshwater flux into the Arctic Ocean comes from snow melt. The timing and magnitude of this flux affects biological and thermodynamic processes in the Arctic Ocean, and potentially across the globe through their impact on North Atlantic Deep Water formation. Several recent global remotely sensed products provide information at unprecedented temporal, spatial, and spectral resolutions. In this article we review the theoretical underpinnings and characteristics of three key products. We also demonstrate the seasonal and spatial patterns of agreement and disagreement amongst them, and discuss current and future directions in their application and development. Though there is general agreement amongst these products, there can be disagreement over certain geographic regions and under conditions of ephemeral, patchy and melting snow. {\textcopyright} 2011 COSPAR.

Because of the different response of the Planck function at different wavelengths, the radiant temperatures measured in two channels may be expressed in terms of contributions from two temperature fields, each occupying a portion of the pixel, where the portions are not necessarily contiguous.

abstract = {Models of processes in the alpine snow cover fundamentally depend on the spatial distribution of the surface energy balance over areas where topographic variability causes huge differences in the incoming solar radiation and in snow depth because of redistribution by wind. At a spatial scale commensurate with that of the terrain, we want to know which areas are covered by snow, and we want to estimate the snow's spectral albedo, along with other properties such as grain size, contaminants, temperature, liquid water content, and depth or water equivalent. From multispectral and hyperspectral remote sensing at wavelengths from 0.4â€“15 $\mu$m, the retrievable properties include snow-covered area, albedo, grain size, liquid water very near the surface, and temperature. Spectral mixture analysis allows the retrieval of the subpixel variability of snow-covered area, along with the snow's albedo. Remaining research challenges include the remote sensing of absorbing impurities; accounting for variabil- ity in the bidirectional-reflectance distribution function and the variability of grain size with depth; retrieving snow cover in forested regions; reconciling field measurements of emissivity with snow properties; and adapting the algorithms to frequent, large-scale processing.},

abstract = {Introduction The Snow User Guide to Collection 5 of the MODIS snow products has been infused and expanded with information regarding characteristics and quality of snow products at each level. A user should find information on characteristics and quality that affect interpretation and use of the products. In content this guide includes information and explanations that should enlighten a user's understanding of the products. Each product section of the guide has been expanded to include descriptions and explanations of characteristics and quality of the product and the online guide has links (or future links) to imagery and graphics exemplifying those characteristics. The MODIS snow product suite is created as a sequence of products beginning with a swath (scene) and progressing, through spatial and temporal transformations, to a monthly global snow product. Each snow product in the sequence after the swath product assimilates accuracy and error from the preceding product. A user must understand how the accuracy and quality of that daily snow product is affected by the previous level(s) of input products. Distribution statistics from the DAAC reveal that the daily tile snow product is the most frequently distributed of the snow products. Review of the literature also shows that the daily and eight-day products are the most utilized products from the sequence of products. Therefore, understanding the assimilation of accuracy and error between levels and through higher levels is necessary to make optimal use of the products. Description of assimilated error and how it affects the accuracy of the product is included in each product section. A user may want to study the preceding product(s) description to enhance their understanding of the product accuracy. MODIS Terra and MODIS Aqua versions of the snow products are generated. This user guide applies to products generated from both sensors but is written based primarily on the Terra products. Bias to Terra is because the snow detection algorithm is based on use of near infrared data at 1.6 Âµm. A primary key to snow detection is the characteristic of snow to have high visible reflectance and low reflectance in the near infrared, MODIS band 6. MODIS band 6 (1.6 Âµm) on Terra is fully functional however, MODIS band 6 on Aqua is only about 30{\%} functional; 70{\%} of the band 6 detectors non-functional. That situation on Aqua caused a switch to band 7 (2.1 Âµm) for snow mapping in the swath level algorithm. The bias to Terra is also because of the greater understanding of the MODIS Terra sensor, pre-launch algorithm development, 1 of 80 longer data record of Terra and greater amount of testing the Terra algorithms in preparation for Collection 5 processing. Discussion of reasons for the different bands and the effect on snow mapping are beyond the scope of this user guide but are discussed in the MODIS snow ATBD (modis-snow-ice.gsfc.nasa.gov/). Despite the different band usage, the snow map algorithms are very similar and the quality of snow mapping is very similar though subtle differences exist between the products. The higher level (Level-3) product algorithms are the same for Terra and Aqua. Similarities and differences between Terra and Aqua are presented in the appropriate product section. The guide is organized into overview sections and data product sections. Overview sections cover commonalities in the data products or describe external sources of information relevant to the products. Data product sections are composed of a succinct algorithm description, data content description and explanations of error and characteristics that should enlighten a user's understanding of each snow product.

abstract = {The first issue of WRR appeared eight years after the launch of Sputnik, but by WRR's 25th anniversary, only seven papers that used remote sensing had appeared. Over the journal's second 25 years, that changed remarkably, and remote sensing is now widely used in hydrology and other geophysical sciences. We attribute this evolution to production of data sets that scientists not well versed in remote sensing can use, and to educational initiatives like NASA's Earth System Science Fellowship program that has supported over a thousand scientists, many in hydrology. We review progress in remote sensing in hydrology from a water balance perspective. We argue that progress is primarily attributable to a creative use of existing and past satellite sensors to estimate such variables as evapotranspiration rates or water storage in lakes and reservoirs and to new and planned missions. Recent transforming technologies include the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE), the European Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) and U.S. Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) missions, and the Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) mission. Future missions include Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) to measure river discharge and lake, reservoir, and wetland storage. Measurement of some important hydrologic variables remains problematic: retrieval of snow water equivalent (SWE) from space remains elusive especially in mountain areas, even though snow cover extent is well observed, and was the topic of 4 of the first 5 remote sensing papers published in WRR. We argue that this area deserves more strategic thinking from the hydrology community.},

abstract = {The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) was launched in December 1999 on the polar orbiting Terra spacecraft and since February 2000 has been acquiring daily global data in 36 spectral bands-29 with 1 km, five with 500 m, and two with 250 m nadir pixel dimensions. The Terra satellite has on-board exterior orientation (position and attitude) measurement systems designed to enable geolocation of MODIS data to approximately 150 m (1??) at nadir. A global network of ground control points is being used to determine biases and trends in the sensor orientation. Biases have been removed by updating models of the spacecraft and instrument orientation in the MODIS geolocation software several times since launch and have improved the MODIS geolocation to approximately 50 m (1??) at nadir. This paper overviews the geolocation approach, summarizes the first year of geolocation analysis, and overviews future work. The approach allows an operational characterization of the MODIS geolocation errors and enables individual MODIS observations to be geolocated to the sub-pixel accuracies required for terrestrial global change applications. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

abstract = {Forest canopies influence the proportion of the land surface that is visible from above, or the viewable gap fraction (VGF). The VGF limits the amount of information available in satellite data about the land surface, such as snow cover in forests. Efforts to recover fractional snow cover from the spectral mixture analysis model Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) snow-covered area and grain size (MODSCAG) indicate the importance of view angle effects in forested landscapes. The VGF can be estimated using both hemispherical photos and forest canopy models. For a set of stands in the Cold Land Field Processes Experiment (CLPX) sites in the Fraser Experimental Forest in Colorado, the convergence of both measurements and models of the VGF as a function of view angle supports the idea that VGF can be characterized as a function of forest properties. A simple geometric optical (GO) model that includes only between-crown gaps can capture the basic shape of the VGF as a function of view zenith angle. However, the GO model tends to underestimate the VGF compared with estimates derived from hemispherical photos, particularly at high view angles. The use of a more complicated geometric optical-radiative transfer (GORT) model generally improves estimates of the VGF by taking into account within-crown gaps. Small footprint airborne lidar data are useful for mapping forest cover and height, which makes the parameterization of the GORT model possible over a landscape. Better knowledge of the angular distribution of gaps in forest canopies holds promise for improving remote sensing of snow cover fraction.},

abstract = {Use of satellite multi-spectral remote-sensing data to map snow and estimate snow characteristics over remote and inaccessible areas requires that we distinguish snow from other surface cover and from clouds, and compensate for the effects of the atmosphere and rugged terrain. Because our space-borne radiometers typically measure reflectance in a few wavelength bands, for climate modeling we must use inferences of snow grain-size and contaminant amount to estimate snow albedo throughout the solar spectrum. Although digital elevation data may be used to simulate typical conditions for a satellite image, precise registration of an elevation data set with satellite data is usually impossible. Instead, an atmospheric model simulates combinations of Thematic Mapper (TM) band radiances for snow of various grain-sizes and contaminant amounts. These can be recognized in TM images and snow can automatically be distinguished from other surfaces and classified into clean new snow, older metamorphosed snow, or snow mixed with vegetation.},

abstract = {A snow-cover mapping method accounting for forests (SnowFrac) is presented. SnowFrac uses spectral unmixing and endmember constraints to estimate the snow-cover fraction of a pixel. The unmixing is based on a linear spectral mixture model, which includes endmembers for snow, conifer, branches of leafless deciduous trees and snow-free ground. Model input consists of a land-cover fraction map and endmember spectra. The land-cover fraction map is applied in the unmixing procedure to identify the number and types of endmembers for every pixel, but also to set constraints on the area fractions of the forest endmembers. SnowFrac was applied on two Terra Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) images with different snow conditions covering a forested area in southern Norway. Six experiments were carried out, each with different endmember constraints. Estimated snow-cover fractions were compared with snow-cover fraction reference maps derived from two Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) images acquired the same days as the MODIS images. Results are presented for non-forested areas, deciduous forests, coniferous forests and mixed deciduous/coniferous forests. The snow-cover fraction estimates are enhanced by increasing constraints introduced to the unmixing procedure. The classification accuracy shows that 96{\%} of the pixels are classified with less than 20{\%} error (absolute units) on 7 May 2001 when all forested and non-forested areas are included. The corresponding figure for 4 May 2000 is 88{\%}. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {One of the major issues with spectral mixture analysis remains the lack of ability to properly account for the spectral variability of endmembers (EMs). EM variability is most often addressed using large spectral libraries incorporating the variability present in the image. We propose a new geometric-based methodology to efficiently evaluate different binary EM combinations. Our approach selects the best EM combination prior to unmixing, building upon the equivalence between the reconstruction error in least squares unmixing and spectral angle minimization in geometric unmixing. This geometric approach is tested on both a simulated data set based on field measurements and a HyMap image. It is demonstrated that selecting the best EM combination for a pixel based on the angle minimization provided identical results compared with using the projection distance or reconstruction error. It also has the additional benefit of reducing the computation time due to the simplicity of the angle calculations. {\textcopyright} 2014 IEEE.},

abstract = {AbstractGridded spatio-temporal maps of precipitation are essential for hydrometeorological and ecological analyses. In the United States, most of these datasets are developed using the Cooperative Observer Network (COOP) of ground-based precipitation measurements, interpolation, and the Parameter Regression against Independent Slopes Model (PRISM) to map these measurements to places where data are not available. Here we evaluate two daily datasets gridded at 1/16Â° resolution against independent daily observations from over 100 snow pillows in California?s Sierra Nevada from 1990 to 2010. Over the entire period, the gridded datasets performed reasonably well, with water year total errors between Â±10{\%}. However, errors in individual storm events sometimes exceeded 50{\%} for the median difference across all stations, and in many cases, the same underpredicted storms appear in both datasets. Synoptic analysis reveals that these underpredicted storms storms coincide with 700 hPa winds from the west or northwest, which are associated with post-cold-frontal flow and disproportionately small precipitation rates in low-elevation valley locations, where the COOP stations are primarily located. This atmospheric circulation leads to a stronger than normal valley-to-mountain precipitation gradient and underestimation of actual mountain precipitation. Because of the small average number of storms ({\textless}10) reaching California each year, these individual storm misses can lead to large biases ({\~{}}20{\%}) in total water year precipitation and thereby significantly affect estimates of statewide water resources.},

abstract = {Characterization of snow is critical for understanding Earth's water and energy cycles. Maps of snow from MODIS have seen growing use in investigations of climate, hydrology, and glaciology, but the lack of rigorous validation of different snow mapping methods compromises these studies. We examine three widely used MODIS snow products: the "binary" (i.e., snow yes/no) global snow maps that were among the initial MODIS standard products; a more recent standard MODIS fractional snow product; and another fractional snow product, MODSCAG, based on spectral mixture analysis. We compare them to maps of snow obtained from Landsat ETM+ data, whose 30. m spatial resolution provides nearly 300 samples within a 500. m MODIS nadir pixel. The assessment uses 172 images spanning a range of snow and vegetation conditions, including the Colorado Rocky Mountains, the Upper Rio Grande, California's Sierra Nevada, and the Nepal Himalaya. MOD10A1 binary and fractional fail to retrieve snow in the transitional periods during accumulation and melt while MODSCAG consistently maintains its retrieval ability during these periods. Averaged over all regions, the RMSE for MOD10A1 fractional is 0.23, whereas the MODSCAG RMSE is 0.10. MODSCAG performs the most consistently through accumulation, mid-winter and melt, with median differences ranging from -0.16 to 0.04 while differences for MOD10A1 fractional range from -0.34 to 0.35. MODSCAG maintains its performance over all land cover classes and throughout a larger range of land surface properties. Characterizing snow cover by spectral mixing is more accurate than empirical methods based on the normalized difference snow index, both for identifying where snow is and is not and for estimating the fractional snow cover within a sensor's instantaneous field-of-view. Determining the fractional value is particularly important during spring and summer melt in mountainous terrain, where large variations in snow, vegetation and soil occur over small distances and when snow can melt rapidly. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {MODIS, the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer, will be launched in 1998 as part of the {\textregistered}rst earth observing system (EOS) platform. Global maps of land surface properties, including snow cover, will be created from MODIS imagery. The MODIS snow-cover mapping algorithm that will be used to produce daily maps of global snow cover extent at 500 m resolution is currently under development. With the exception of cloud cover, the largest limitation to producing a global daily snow cover product using MODIS is the presence of a forest canopy. A Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) time-series of the southern Boreal EcosystemÂ±Atmosphere Study (BOREAS) study area in Prince Albert National Park, Saskatchewan, was used to evaluate the performance of the current MODIS snow-cover mapping algorithm in varying forest types. A snow reÂ¯ectance model was used in conjunction with a canopy reÂ¯ectance model (GeoSAIL) to model the reÂ¯ectance of a snow-covered forest stand. Using these coupled models, the eÂ€ects of varying forest type, canopy density, snow grain size and solar illumination geometry on the performance of the MODIS snow-cover mapping algorithm were investigated. Using both the TM images and the reÂ¯ectance models, two changes to the current MODIS snow-cover mapping algorithm are proposed that will improve the algorithm's classi{\textregistered}cation accuracy in forested areas. The improvements include using the normalized diÂ€erence snow index and normalized diÂ€erence vegetation index in combination to discriminate better between snow-covered and snow-free forests. A minimum albedo threshold of 10{\%} in the visible wavelengths is also proposed. This will prevent dense forests with very low visible albedos from being classi{\textregistered}ed incorrectly as snow. These two changes increase the amount of snow mapped in forests on snow-covered TM scenes, and decrease the area incorrectly identi{\textregistered}ed as snow on non-snow-covered TM scenes. {\#}},

The daily products have data gaps and errors because of cloud cover and sensor viewing geometry. Rather than make users interpolate and filter these patchy daily maps without completely understanding the retrieval algorithm and instrument properties, we use the daily time series to improve the estimate of the measured snow properties for a particular day. We use a combination of noise filtering, snow/cloud discrimination, and interpolation and smoothing to produce our best estimate of the daily snow cover and albedo. We consider two modes: one is the "predictive" mode, whereby we estimate the snow-covered area and albedo on that day using only the data up to that day; the other is the "retrospective" mode, whereby we reconstruct the history of the snow properties for a previous period. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Snow-cover information is important for a wide variety of scientific studies, water supply and management applications. The NASA Earth Observing System (EOS) Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) provides improved capabilities to observe snow cover from space and has been successfully using a normalized difference snow index (NDSI), along with threshold tests, to provide global, automated binary maps of snow cover. The NDSI is a spectral band ratio that takes advantage of the spectral differences of snow in short-wave infrared and visible MODIS spectral bands to identify snow versus other features in a scene. This study has evaluated whether there is a "signal" in the NDSI that could be used to estimate the fraction of snow within a 500 m MODIS pixel and thereby enhance the use of the NDSI approach in monitoring snow cover. Using Landsat 30-m observations as "ground truth," the percentage of snow cover was calculated for 500-m cells. Then a regression relationship between 500-m NDSI observations and fractional snow cover was developed over three different snow-covered regions and tested over other areas. The overall results indicate that the relationship between fractional snow cover and NDSI is reasonably robust when applied locally and over large areas like North America. The relationship offers advantages relative to other published fractional snow cover algorithms developed for global-scale use with MODIS. This study indicates that the fraction of snow cover within a MODIS pixel using this approach can be provided with a mean absolute error less than 0.1 over the range from 0.0 to 1.0 in fractional snow cover. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Snow is among the most "colorful" materials in nature, but most of the variability in snow reflectance occurs beyond 0.8 $\mu$m rather than in the visible spectrum. In these wavelengths, reflectance decreases dramatically as the snow grains evolve and grow, whereas in the visible spectrum snow reflectance is degraded by contaminants such as dust, algae, and soot. From imaging spectrometer data, we can estimate the grain size of the snow in the surface layer, and thereby derive spectral and broadband albedo. We can also estimate the fraction of each pixel that is covered by snow, the liquid water content in the surface layer, and the amount of radiative forcing caused by absorbing impurities. Estimates of fractional snow-covered area and albedo dramatically improve the performance of spatially distributed snowmelt models that include net solar radiation as an input value, most significantly in locations and at times where incident solar radiation is high and temperatures low. Experience with imaging spectrometer data has allowed extension of the fractional snow-cover and albedo estimates to multispectral sensors, particularly MODIS, the Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {How does snow's anisotropic directional reflectance affect the mapping of snow properties from imaging spectrometer data? This sensitivity study applies two spectroscopy models to synthetic images of the spectral hemispherical- directional reflectance factor (HDRF) with prescribed snow-covered area and snow grain size. The MEMSCAG model determines both sub-pixel snow-covered area and the grain size of the fractional snow cover. The Nolin/Dozier model analyzes the ice absorption feature that spans wavelength $\lambda$â‰…1.03 $\mu$m to estimate snow grain radius when the pixel is fully snow-covered. Retrievals of subpixel snow-covered area with MEMSCAG are progressively more sensitive to the HDRF as grain size decreases, solar zenith angle increases, and fractional snow cover increases. The model overestimates snow cover in the forward reflectance angles by up to +20{\%} and underestimates it in the backward reflectance angles by as much as -15{\%}. Grain size retrievals from both MEMSCAG and Nolin/Dozier are more sensitive to anisotropy as grain size and solar zenith angle increase. MEMSCAG retrievals of grain size are insensitive to snow-covered area. The largest inferred grain sizes occur around a peak in the backward reflectance angles and the smallest generally occur at the largest view angles in the forward direction. Retrievals of albedo from MEMSCAG and Nolin/Dozier are similarly sensitive to anisotropy, with albedo errors up to 5{\%} for a 30Â° solar zenith angle and up to 10{\%} at 60Â°. The albedo differences between the two models are less than 0.015 for all grain sizes and solar zenith angles. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {An Airborne Visible / Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) image collected over the Jasper Ridge Biological Preserve, California on 20 September 1989 was analyzed using spectral mixture analysis. The scene was calibrated to reflectance assuming a homogeneous atmosphere. The image was modeled initially as linear mixtures of the minimum number of reference endmember spectra that accounted for the maximum spectral variability. Over 98{\%} of the spectral variation was explained by linear mixtures of three endmembers: green vegetation, shade, and soil. Additional spectral variation appeared as residuals. Nonlinear mixing was expressed as variations in the fraction of each endmember when a linear mixing model was applied to spectral subsets of the entire spectrum. After the fractions of the endmember spectra were calculated for each pixel, different types of soil were discriminated by the residual spectra. Nonphotosynthetic vegetation (NPV) (e.g., dry grass, leaf litter, and woody material), which could not be distinguished from soil when included as an endmember, was discriminated by residual spectra that contained cellulose and lignin absorptions. Distinct communities of green vegetation were distinguished by 1) nonlinear mixing effects caused by transmission and scattering by green leaves, 2) variations in a derived canopy-shade spectrum, and 3) the fraction of NPV. The results of the image analysis, supported by field observations in 1990 and 1991, indicate that the multiple bands of AVIRIS enhance discrimination of NPV from soil, and the separation of different types of green vegetation. The ability of the system to measure narrow absorption bands is one important factor; however, also important is the variation in continuum spectra expressed by the endmembers, and characteristic nonlinear mixing effects associated with green leaves. {\textcopyright} 1993.},

abstract = {All currently available climate models predict a near-surface warming trend under the influence of rising levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. In addition to the direct effects on climate--for example, on the frequency of heatwaves--this increase in surface temperatures has important consequences for the hydrological cycle, particularly in regions where water supply is currently dominated by melting snow or ice. In a warmer world, less winter precipitation falls as snow and the melting of winter snow occurs earlier in spring. Even without any changes in precipitation intensity, both of these effects lead to a shift in peak river runoff to winter and early spring, away from summer and autumn when demand is highest. Where storage capacities are not sufficient, much of the winter runoff will immediately be lost to the oceans. With more than one-sixth of the Earth's population relying on glaciers and seasonal snow packs for their water supply, the consequences of these hydrological changes for future water availability--predicted with high confidence and already diagnosed in some regions--are likely to be severe.},

abstract = {We describe and validate a model that retrieves fractional snow-covered area and the grain size and albedo of that snow from surface reflectance data (product MOD09GA) acquired by NASA's Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). The model analyzes the MODIS visible, near infrared, and shortwave infrared bands with multiple endmember spectral mixtures from a library of snow, vegetation, rock, and soil. We derive snow spectral endmembers of varying grain size from a radiative transfer model specific to a scene's illumination geometry; spectra for vegetation, rock, and soil were collected in the field and laboratory. We validate the model with fractional snow cover estimates from Landsat Thematic Mapper data, at 30 m resolution, for the Sierra Nevada, Rocky Mountains, high plains of Colorado, and Himalaya. Grain size measurements are validated with field measurements during the Cold Land Processes Experiment, and albedo retrievals are validated with in situ measurements in the San Juan Mountains of Colorado. The pixel-weighted average RMS error for snow-covered area across 31 scenes is 5{\%}, ranging from 1{\%} to 13{\%}. The mean absolute error for grain size was 51 $\mu$m and the mean absolute error for albedo was 4.2{\%}. Fractional snow cover errors are relatively insensitive to solar zenith angle. Because MODSCAG is a physically based algorithm that accounts for the spatial and temporal variation in surface reflectances of snow and other surfaces, it is capable of global snow cover mapping in its more computationally efficient, operational mode. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {A new technique, called multiple endmember spectral mixture analysis (MESMA), was developed and tested in the Santa Monica Mountains, using Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) data acquired in the fall of 1994 to map California chaparral. The technique models remotely measured spectra as linear combinations of pure spectra, called endmembers, while allowing the types and number of endmembers to vary on a per pixel basis. In this manner, vegetation is characterized by a unique set of endmembers as well as by the fractions. Reference endmembers were selected from a library of field and laboratory measured spectra of leaves, canopies, nonphotosynthetic materials (e.g., stems), and soils and used to develop a series of candidate models. Each candidate model was applied to the image, then, on a per pixel basis, assessed in terms of fractions, root mean squared (RMS) error, and residuals. If a model met all criteria, it was listed as a candidate for that pixel. For this study, selection criteria included fractions between -0.01 and 1.01, an RMS less than 0.025 and a residual less than 0.025 in seven or more contiguous bands. A total of 889 two-endmember models were evaluated and used to generate 276 three-endmember models. To facilitate model selection from a large pool of candidates, an optimal set was selected to provide maximal areal coverage. A total of 24 two-endmember and 12 three-endmember models were chosen. These models were used to generate fraction images and vegetation maps showing evergreen and drought deciduous or senesced vegetation. We found that a majority of the image could be modeled as two-endmember models. Three-endmember models provided greater areal coverage, yet provided poorer vegetation discrimination due to an increase in model overlap (two or more model candidates modeling the same pixel). The vegetation maps demonstrate that the technique is capable of discriminating a large number of spectrally distinct types of vegetation while capturing the mosaic-like spatial distribution typical of chaparral. However, additional research is required to fully evaluate the technique and validate the vegetation maps that were produced.},

The model analyzes multiple endmember spectral mixtures with a spectral library of snow, vegetation, rock, and soil. We derive snow spectral endmembers of varying grain size from a radiative transfer model; spectra for vegetation, rock, and soil were collected in the field and laboratory. For three AVIRIS images of Mammoth Mountain, California that span common snow conditions for winter through spring, we validate the estimates of snow-covered area with fine-resolution aerial photographs and validate the estimates of grain size with stereological analysis of snow samples collected within 2 h of the AVIRIS overpasses. The RMS error for snow-covered area retrieved from AVIRIS for the combined set of three images was 4{\%}. The RMS error for snow grain size retrieved from a 3 x 3 window of AVIRIS data for the combined set of three images is 48 $\mu$m, and the RMS error for reflectance integrated over the solar spectrum and over all hemispherical reflectance angles is 0.018. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Science Inc.

We model winter and spring reference scenes as linear mixtures of image end member spectra to produce the response variables for tree-based regression and classification models. Decision trees identify cloud cover and fractional snow-covered area. We test the algorithm on a different Thematic Mapper scene and verify with highresolution, large-format, color aerial photography. The accuracy of the automated classification of Thematic Mapper data equals that obtainable from the aerial photographs but is faster, cheaper, and covers a vastly larger area.

abstract = {California's spring snowpack provides a critical water resource that may be greatly reduced by greenhouse warming. However, warming over the past half century has had little effect on total summer water discharge. The region's snowpack may therefore be less sensitive to temperature change than predicted by numerical models. In this study, 53 years of 1 April snow course measurements of snow-water equivalent (SWE) from the Sierra Nevada are used in a spatially distributed covariance model of SWE sensitivity to temperature and precipitation. This model is applied at a 2.5 arc min resolution using a multivariate parameter-surface interpolation scheme and Parameter-elevation Regressions on Independent Slopes (PRISM) climate grids. Total modeled SWE volume has a greater covariance to precipitation than to temperature. Increasing precipitation and temperature from 1950 to 2002 has led to an increase in SWE at high elevations and a loss at low elevations, resulting in little or no overall change in SWE volume. The covariance model predicts a 6 - 10{\%} decrease in total SWE volume per degrees C. However, sensitivity is both highly dependent on concurrent change in precipitation and spatially variable, with the lower-elevation watersheds in the north being the most sensitive to warming. Overall, climate sensitivity is much less than that predicted by numerical models. This difference may result from inadequate treatment of elevation and precipitation in climate models.},

abstract = {Estimating the spatial distribution of snow water equivalent (SWE) in mountainous terrain is currently the most important unsolved problem in snow hydrology. Several methods can estimate the amount of snow throughout a mountain range: (1) Spatial interpolation from surface sensors constrained by remotely sensed snow extent provides a consistent answer, with uncertainty related to extrapola-tion to unrepresented locations. (2) The remotely sensed date of disappearance of snow is combined with a melt calculation to reconstruct the SWE back to the last significant snowfall. (3) Passive microwave sensors offer real-time global SWE estimates but suffer from several problems like subpixel variability in the mountains. (4) A numerical model combined with assimilated surface observations produces SWE at 1-km resolution at continental scales, but depends heavily on a surface network. (5) New methods continue to be explored, for example, airborne LiDAR altimetry provides direct measurements of snow depth, which are combined with modelled snow density to estimate SWE. While the problem is aggressively addressed, the right answer remains elusive. Good characterization of the snow is necessary to make informed choices about water resources and adaptation to climate change and variability.},

abstract = {Computational provenance--a record of the antecedents and processing history of digital information--is key to properly documenting computer-based scientific research. To support investigations in hydrologic science, we produce the daily fractional snow-covered area from NASA's moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS). From the MODIS reflectance data in seven wavelengths, we estimate the fraction of each 500 m pixel that snow covers. The daily products have data gaps and errors because of cloud cover and sensor viewing geometry, so we interpolate and smooth to produce our best estimate of the daily snow cover. To manage the data, we have developed the Earth System Science Server (ES3), a software environment for data-intensive Earth science, with unique capabilities for automatically and transparently capturing and managing the provenance of arbitrary computations. Transparent acquisition avoids the scientists having to express their computations in specific languages or schemas in order for provenance to be acquired and maintained. ES3 models provenance as relationships between processes and their input and output files. It is particularly suited to capturing the provenance of an evolving algorithm whose components span multiple languages and execution environments.},

abstract = {The study of urban climate requires frequent and accurate monitoring of land surface temperature (LST), at the local scale. Since currently, no space-borne sensor provides frequent thermal infrared imagery at high spatial resolution, the scientific community has focused on synergistic methods for retrieving LST that can be suitable for urban studies. Synergistic methods that combine the spatial structure of visible and near-infrared observations with the more frequent, but low-resolution surface temperature patterns derived by thermal infrared imagery provide excellent means for obtaining frequent LST estimates at the local scale in cities. In this study, a new approach based on spatial-spectral unmixing techniques was developed for improving the spatial resolution of thermal infrared observations and the subsequent LST estimation. The method was applied to an urban area in Crete, Greece, for the time period of one year. The results were evaluated against independent high-resolution LST datasets and found to be very promising, with RMSE less than 2 K in all cases. The developed approach has therefore a high potential to be operationally used in the near future, exploiting the Copernicus Sentinel (2 and 3) observations, to provide high spatio-temporal resolution LST estimates in cities.},

abstract = {Estimation of snow characteristics from satellite remote sensing data requires that we distinguish snow from other surface cover and from clouds, compensate for the effects of the atmosphere and rugged terrain, and interpolate snow albedo over the entire solar spectrum from measurements at a few wavelengths. We also need to account for topographic effects without requiring that satellite data be precisely registered to digital elevation data, because the poor quality of most digital elevation data introduces considerable noise into calculations of slope and azimuth. From simulation of a range of snow types and various atmospheric profiles, over possible illumination conditions, we can develop typical spectral signatures above the atmosphere over mountainous terrain. Landsat Thematic Mapper data of the southern Sierra Nevada are analyzed to distinguish several classes of snow from other surface covers. Snow can be reliably mapped at all sun angles encountered in the mid-latitudes, and large surface grain sizes can be distinguished from areas where the grain size is finer at the snow surface. Because of saturation in TM band 1, estimation of the degree of contamination by absorbing aerosols is not feasible. {\textcopyright} 1989.},

abstract = {An algorithm is being developed to map global snow cover using Earth Observing System (EOS) Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer ('MODIS) data be- ginning at launch in 1998. As currently planned, digital maps will be produced that will provide daily, and per- haps maximum weekly, global snow cover at 500-m spa- tial resolution. Statistics will be generated on the extent and persistence of snow cover in each pixelfor each weekly map, cloud cover permitting. It will also be possible to generate snow-cover maps at 250-ni spatial resolution using MODIS data, and to study snow-cover characteris- tics. Preliminary validation activities of the prototype version of our snow-mapping algorithm, SNOMAP, have been undertaken. SNOMAP will use criteria tests and a decision rule to identify snow in each 500-m MODIS pixel. fUse of SNOMAP on a previously mapped Landsat Thematic Mapper (TAl) scene of the Sierra ]Nevadas has shown that SNOMAP is 98{\%} accurate in identifying snow in pixels that are snow covered bn 60{\%} or more. Results of a comparison of a SNOMAP classification with a super- vised-classification technique on six other TM scenes show that SNOMAP and supervised-classification techniques agree to within about I I {\%} or less for nearly cloud-free scenes and that SNOMAP provided motre consistent re- sults. About 10 {\%} of the snow cover, known to be present on the 14 March 1991 TM scene covering Glacier National Park in northern Montana, is obscured by dense forest cover. Mapping snow cover in areas of dense forests is a limitation in the use of this procedure for global snow- cover mapping. This limitation, and sources of error will be assessed globally as SNO1MAP is refined and tested before},

The performance of this algorithm and algorithms applicable to the MODIS on the Terra spacecraft are compared. Validation efforts show that both pixel-level, fractional snow cover relationships for the Terra and Aqua MODIS instruments work well as quantified by such measures as correlation coefficient (r) and root-mean-square error when compared to Landat-7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper ground-truth observations covering a substantial range of snow cover conditions. Over all the scenes used herein, the correlation coefficients were near 0.9 and the RMSE near 0.10. However, somewhat better performance was found for the Terra MODIS versus the Aqua MODIS over nearly concurrently observed scenes. Furthermore, it is clear that more improvements in fractional snow cover estimates within MODIS pixels should be pursued to better account for variability in slope and aspect, atmospheric effects, snow cover types, and land cover},
