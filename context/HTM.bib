abstract = {An earlier paper (Szalay et. al. "Designing and Mining MultiTerabyte Astronomy Archives: The Sloan Digital Sky Survey," ACM SIGMOD 2000) described the Sloan Digital Sky Survey's (SDSS) data management needs by defining twenty database queries and twelve data visualization tasks that a good data management system should support. We built a database and interfaces to support both the query load and also a website for ad-hoc access. This paper reports on the database design, describes the data loading pipeline, and reports on the query implementation and performance. The queries typically translated to a single SQL statement. Most queries run in less than 20 seconds, allowing scientists to interactively explore the database. This paper is an in-depth tour of those queries. Readers should first have studied the companion overview paper Szalay et. al. "The SDSS SkyServer, Public Access to the Sloan Digital Sky Server Data" ACM SIGMOND 2002.},

annote = {The authors proposed the establishment of a Geodesic Elevation Model in which locations of elevation measurements are encoded/indexed in a quadtree. The quadtree is created by recursively tessellating the facets of a regular solid, in this case, an octahedron.
The triangle faces of the octahedron are broken down with the triacon breakdown. In a single step, the triacon triples the number of facets on each iteration and results in two alternating hierarchies. Every level though is fully contained within the level two steps above; two triacon breakdown steps therefore tessellate a triangle into nine smaller triangles. The address/index/code (``gemcode'') of each triangle is the concatenation of the facet numbers (one through nine) iterated through to arrive at the triangle. 
The author envisages a replacement of coordinates in geospatial data with geocodes, given that the community could agree on a common method to generate geocodes.},

abstract = {The concept of the sphere quadtree (SQT) is introduced to enable the structuring of spherically distributed data to be consistent with its geometry and facilitate mapping of the data onto a flat file system. The SQT is based on the recursive subdivision of the spherical triangles that result from the projection of the faces of an icosahedron onto a sphere. The SQT concept is insensitive to the distortions that occur far from the equator in spherically distributed data sets. Geographic data can be shown at several levels and at any resolution, allowing a system of referencing between data sets of different resolutions as well as data that are not geographically registered. SQTs are found to facilitate the search for particular spherically distributed data sets and improve the efficiency of surface rendering algorithms.},

The HTM gives us a very efficient indexing method for objects localized on the sphere. We also developed a simple geometrical method to define an arbitrary area on the sphere which can be intersected by the HTM, returning the triangles covered by the area.

In this contribution we define the Hierarchical Triangular Mesh, the geometric querying and we give concrete numbers of the performance of the current implementation.},

abstract = {Planetary geocoding using polyhedral tessellations are a concise and elegant way to organize both local and global geospatial data that respects and documents locational accuracy. After a brief review of several such spatial referencing systems, topological, computational, and geometric properties of one of them are examined. The particular model described in the remainder of the paper – the octahedral quaternary triangular mesh (O-QTM) – is being devel-oped to handle and visualize vector-format geodata in a hierarchical triangulated domain. The second section analyzes the geometric regularity of the model, showing that its facets are relatively similar, having vertices spaced uniformly in latitude and longitude, and areas that vary by less than 42 {\%} from their mean sizes. Section 3 describes some fundamental operations on this structure, including mapping from geographic coordinates into O-QTM addresses and back again, filtering map detail through the triangular hierarchy and associ-ating locations that are close together, but in different branches of the tree structure. The final section outlines and illustrates a recent application of O-QTM to map generalization, using its multi-resolution properties to enable multiple cartographic representations to be built from a single hierarchical geospatial database.},

As a result, such databases possess undesirable artifacts, including the introduction of "tears" in the data when they are mapped onto a flat file system. Furthermore, it is difficult to make queries about the topological relationship among the data components without performing real arithmetic.

The SQT allows the representation of data at multiple levels and arbitrary resolution. Efficient search strategies can be implemented for the selection of data to be rendered or analyzed by a specific technique. Furthermore, sphere quadtrees offer significant potential for improving the accuracy and efficiency of spherical surface rendering algorithms as well as for spatial data management and geographic information systems.

To facilitate data mining in the SDSS archive, we adapted a commercial database engine and built specialized tools on top of it. Originally we chose an object-oriented database management system due to its data organization capabilities, platform independence, query performance and conceptual fit to the data. However, after using the object database for the first couple of years of the project, it soon began to fall short in terms of its query support and data mining performance. This was as much due to the inability of the database vendor to respond our demands for features and bug fixes as it was due to their failure to keep up with the rapid improvements in hardware performance, particularly faster RAID disk systems. In the end, we were forced to abandon the object database and migrate our data to a relational database.
