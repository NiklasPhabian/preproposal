abstract = {In earth observation and climatological sciences, data and their data services grow on a daily basis in a large spatial extent due to the high coverage rate of satellite sensors, model calculations, but also by continuous meteorological in situ observations. In order to reuse such data, especially data fragments as well as their data services in a collaborative and reproducible manner by citing the origin source, data analysts, e.g., researchers or impact modelers, need a possibility to identify the exact version, precise time information, parameter, and names of the dataset used. A manual process would make the citation of data fragments as a subset of an entire dataset rather complex and imprecise to obtain. Data in climate research are in most cases multidimensional, structured grid data that can change partially over time. The citation of such evolving content requires the approach of “dynamic data citation”. The applied approach is based on associating queries with persistent identifiers. These queries contain the subsetting parameters, e.g., the spatial coordinates of the desired study area or the time frame with a start and end date, which are automatically included in the metadata of the newly generated subset and thus represent the information about the data history, the data provenance, which has to be established in data repository ecosystems. The Research Data Alliance Data Citation Working Group (RDA Data Citation WG) summarized the scientific status quo as well as the state of the art from existing citation and data management concepts and developed the scalable dynamic data citation methodology of evolving data. The Data Centre at the Climate Change Centre Austria (CCCA) has implemented the given recommendations and offers since 2017 an operational service on dynamic data citation on climate scenario data. With the consciousness that the objective of this topic brings a lot of dependencies on bibliographic citation research which is still under discussion, the CCCA service on Dynamic Data Citation focused on the climate domain specific issues, like characteristics of data, formats, software environment, and usage behavior. The current effort beyond spreading made experiences will be the scalability of the implementation, e.g., towards the potential of an Open Data Cube solution.},

abstract = {Reproducibility of research can be improved by increasing transparency of the research process and products. This document provides template guidelines to enhance transparency in the science that journals publish. With minor adaptation of the text, funders can adopt these guidelines for research that they fund. There are eight transparency standards covered by these guidelines. The guidelines are modular so they can be adopted singly or collectively: 1. Citation 2. Data transparency 3. Analytic methods (code) transparency 4. Research materials transparency 5. Design and analysis transparency 6. Preregistration of studies 7. Preregistration of analysis plans 8. Replication Each category template text for three levels of transparency: Level 1, Level 2, and Level 3. Adopting journals select among the levels based on readiness to adopt milder to stronger transparency standards for authors and researchers. There are many factors that will influence level selection including considerations for implementation, and concordance with disciplinary norms and expectations. Defining distinct standards and multiple levels facilitates journals' making informed decisions among the possibilities. Also, it acknowledges and embraces the variation in evolving norms about research transparency in the present science ecosystem. The TOP Guidelines Committee, sponsored by the ​ Center for Open Science​ , maintains an information commons​ for transparency standards, serves as an advisory group for journals and funders, evaluate guidelines' effectiveness, and manages guideline updating to maximize quality and interdisciplinary applicability. Updates to standards are recorded with version number and date. Adopting journals and funders can denote the version number that they adopt to facilitate tracking and updating of standards over time. The remainder of this document provides template guideline text for Level 1, 2, and 3 transparency standards for each category. The ​ Appendix​ provides the full­text template for each level, and the ​ TOP Guidelines Summary​ table provides an accessible overview of the Levels as well as a comparison of common journal policies that do not meet the transparency standards.},

abstract = {Citations are the cornerstone of knowledge propagation and the primary means of assessing the quality of research, as well as directing investments in science. Science is increasingly becoming "data-intensive", where large volumes of data are collected and analyzed to discover complex patterns through simulations and experiments, and most scientific reference works have been replaced by online curated datasets. Yet, given a dataset, there is no quantitative, consistent and established way of knowing how it has been used over time, who contributed to its curation, what results have been yielded or what value it has. The development of a theory and practice of data citation is fundamental for considering data as first-class research objects with the same relevance and centrality of traditional scientific products. Many works in recent years have discussed data citation from different viewpoints: illustrating why data citation is needed, defining the principles and outlining recommendations for data citation systems, and providing computational methods for addressing specific issues of data citation. The current panorama is many-faceted and an overall view that brings together diverse aspects of this topic is still missing. Therefore, this paper aims to describe the lay of the land for data citation, both from the theoretical (the why and what) and the practical (the how) angle.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 The Author(s). NASA's Earth Science Data and Information System (ESDIS) Project began investigating the use of Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs) in 2010 with the goal of assigning DOIs to various data products. These Earth science research data products produced using Earth observations and models are archived and distributed by twelve Distributed Active Archive Centers (DAACs) located across the United States. Each data center serves a different Earth science discipline user community and, accordingly, has a unique approach and process for generating and archiving a variety of data products. These varied approaches present a challenge for developing a DOI solution. To address this challenge, the ESDIS Project has developed processes, guidelines, and several models for creating and assigning DOIs. Initially the DOI assignment and registration process was started as a prototype but now it is fully operational. In February 2012, the ESDIS Project started using the California Digital Library (CDL) EZID for registering DOIs. The DOI assignments were initially labor-intensive. The system is now automated, and the assignments are progressing rapidly. As of February 28, 2017, over 50{\%} of the data products at the DAACs had been assigned DOIs. Citations using the DOIs increased from about 100 to over 370 between 2015 and 2016.},

These repositories cannot make any assumption on the application domain. They are actually called to face with the almost open ended typologies of data used in science. The current practices promoted by such reposi-tories are analysed with respect to eight key aspects of data publishing, i.e., dataset format-ting, documentation, licensing, publication costs, validation, availability, discovery and access, and citation. From this analysis it emerges that these repositories implement well consolidated practices and pragmatic solutions for literature repositories. These practices and solutions can not totally meet the needs of management and use of datasets resources, especially in a con-text where rapid technological changes continuously open new exploitation prospects.},

abstract = {Reproducibility and reusability of research results is an important concern in scientific communication and science policy. A foundational element of reproducibility and reusability is the open and persistently available presentation of research data. However, many common approaches for primary data publication in use today do not achieve sufficient long-term robustness, openness, accessibility or uniformity. Nor do they permit comprehensive exploitation by modern Web technologies. This has led to several authoritative studies recommending uniform direct citation of data archived in persistent repositories. Data are to be considered as first-class scholarly objects, and treated similarly in many ways to cited and archived scientific and scholarly literature. Here we briefly review the most current and widely agreed set of principle-based recommendations for scholarly data citation, the Joint Declaration of Data Citation Principles (JDDCP). We then present a framework for operationalizing the JDDCP; and a set of initial recommendations on identifier schemes, identifier resolution behavior, required metadata elements, and best practices for realizing programmatic machine actionability of cited data. The main target audience for the common implementation guidelines in this article consists of publishers, scholarly organizations, and persistent data repositories, including technical staff members in these organizations. But ordinary researchers can also benefit from these recommendations. The guidance provided here is intended to help achieve widespread, uniform human and machine accessibility of deposited data, in support of significantly improved verification, validation, reproducibility and re-use of scholarly/scientific data.},

abstract = {The movement to bring datasets into the scholarly record as first class research products (validated, preserved, cited, and credited) has been inching forward for some time, but now the pace is quickening. As data publication venues proliferate, significant debate continues over formats, processes, and terminology. Here, we present an overview of data publication initiatives underway and the current conversation, highlighting points of consensus and issues still in contention. Data publication implementations differ in a variety of factors, including the kind of documentation, the location of the documentation relative to the data, and how the data is validated. Publishers may present data as supplemental material to a journal article, with a descriptive “data paper,” or independently. Complicating the situation, different initiatives and communities use the same terms to refer to distinct but overlapping concepts. For instance, the term published means that the data is publicly available and citable to virtually everyone, but it may or may not imply that the data has been peer-reviewed. In turn, what is meant by data peer review is far from defined; standards and processes encompass the full range employed in reviewing the literature, plus some novel variations. Basic data citation is a point of consensus, but the general agreement on the core elements of a dataset citation frays if the data is dynamic or part of a larger set. Even as data publication is being defined, some are looking past publication to other metaphors, notably “data as software,” for solutions to the more stubborn problems.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Scientific research in the 21st century is more data intensive and collaborative than in the past. It is important to study the data practices of researchers--data accessibility, discovery, re-use, preservation and, particularly, data sharing. Data sharing is a valuable part of the scientific method allowing for verification of results and extending research from prior results. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: A total of 1329 scientists participated in this survey exploring current data sharing practices and perceptions of the barriers and enablers of data sharing. Scientists do not make their data electronically available to others for various reasons, including insufficient time and lack of funding. Most respondents are satisfied with their current processes for the initial and short-term parts of the data or research lifecycle (collecting their research data; searching for, describing or cataloging, analyzing, and short-term storage of their data) but are not satisfied with long-term data preservation. Many organizations do not provide support to their researchers for data management both in the short- and long-term. If certain conditions are met (such as formal citation and sharing reprints) respondents agree they are willing to share their data. There are also significant differences and approaches in data management practices based on primary funding agency, subject discipline, age, work focus, and world region. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Barriers to effective data sharing and preservation are deeply rooted in the practices and culture of the research process as well as the researchers themselves. New mandates for data management plans from NSF and other federal agencies and world-wide attention to the need to share and preserve data could lead to changes. Large scale programs, such as the NSF-sponsored DataNET (including projects like DataONE) will both bring attention and resources to the issue and make it easier for scientists to apply sound data management principles.},

Some of the concepts and perceptions about DOI for data today have their roots in the way this project implemented DOI for research data and the decisions made in those early days still shape the discussion about the use of persistent identifiers for research data today. This project also laid the foundation for a tighter integration of journal publications and data. Promoted by early adopters, such as PANGAEA, DOI registration for data has reached a high level of maturity and has become an integral part of scientific publishing. This paper discusses the fundamental concepts applied in the identification of DOI for research data and how these can be interpreted for alternative and future applications of persistent identifiers for research data.},

@article{Golodoniuc2017,
abstract = {The need to identify both digital and physical objects is ubiquitous in our society. Past and present persistent identifier (PID) systems, of which there is a great variety in terms of technical and social implementation, have evolved with the advent of the Internet, which has allowed for globally unique and globally resolvable identifiers. PID systems have, by in large, catered for identifier uniqueness, integrity, and persistence, regardless of the identifier's application domain. Trustworthiness of these systems has been measured by the criteria first defined by B{\"{u}}tikofer (2009) and further elaborated by Golodoniuc et al. (2016) and Car et al. (2017). Since many PID systems have been largely conceived and developed by a single organisation they faced challenges for widespread adoption and, most importantly, the ability to survive change of technology. We believe that a cause of PID systems that were once successful fading away is the centralisation of support infrastructure – both organisational and computing and data storage systems. In this paper, we propose a PID system design that implements the pillars of a trustwor-thy system – ensuring identifiers' independence of any particular technology or organisation, implementation of core PID system functions, separation from data delivery, and enabling the system to adapt for future change. We propose decentralisation at all levels — persistent iden-tifiers and information objects registration, resolution, and data delivery — using Distributed Hash Tables and traditional peer-to-peer networks with information replication and caching mechanisms, thus eliminating the need for a central PID data store. This will increase overall system fault tolerance thus ensuring its trustworthiness. We also discuss important aspects of the distributed system's governance, such as the notion of the authoritative source and data integrity.},

@article{Bandrowski2016,
abstract = {A central tenet in support of research reproducibility is the ability to uniquely identify research resources, i.e., reagents, tools, and materials that are used to perform experiments. However, current reporting practices for research resources are insufficient to allow humans and algorithms to identify the exact resources that are reported or answer basic questions such as "What other studies used resource X?" To address this issue, the Resource Identification Initiative was launched as a pilot project to improve the reporting standards for research resources in the methods sections of papers and thereby improve identifiability and reproducibility. The pilot engaged over 25 biomedical journal editors from most major publishers, as well as scientists and funding officials. Authors were asked to include Research Resource Identifiers (RRIDs) in their manuscripts prior to publication for three resource types: antibodies, model organisms, and tools (including software and databases). RRIDs represent accession numbers assigned by an authoritative database, e.g., the model organism databases, for each type of resource. To make it easier for authors to obtain RRIDs, resources were aggregated from the appropriate databases and their RRIDs made available in a central web portal ( www.scicrunch.org/resources). RRIDs meet three key criteria: they are machine readable, free to generate and access, and are consistent across publishers and journals. The pilot was launched in February of 2014 and over 300 papers have appeared that report RRIDs. The number of journals participating has expanded from the original 25 to more than 40. Here, we present an overview of the pilot project and its outcomes to date. We show that authors are generally accurate in performing the task of identifying resources and supportive of the goals of the project. We also show that identifiability of the resources pre- and post-pilot showed a dramatic improvement for all three resource types, suggesting that the project has had a significant impact on reproducibility relating to research resources.},

@article{Kratz2015,
abstract = {Science is built on a foundation of data. The production and publication of that data should be recognized as valuable scholarship, but data lacks an essential prerequisite for modern-day scholarly recognition—accepted metrics of significance. The scientific community has traditionally estimated the impact of a journal article by counting the number of subsequent references to it; more recently, a suite of web-based alternative metrics ('altmetrics') offer faster assessment and the chance capture other kinds of impact 1 . Data can be fit into these article-centered assessment systems by proxy, via data descriptor articles in journals like Earth Systems Science Data or Scientific Data 2,3 . Another approach is to apply familiar metrics directly to datasets published in online databases or repositories. Complicating matters, the same metric may mean different things with respect to articles versus datasets. A researcher can read an article online closely without downloading the PDF version, but if they view a dataset landing page without downloading the data, their level of engagement is almost certainly low. A better understanding of how to measure data impact is critical if we are to reward data creators and incentivize data publication. In recognition of this need, several groups are currently investigating traditional, alternative, and novel metrics for data. The joint Research Data Alliance/World Data System Data Publishing Bibliometrics Working Group aims to 'conceptualize data metrics and corresponding services' (http://go.nature.com/ BszO9f) by investigating current and potential applications for data metrics. The National Information Standards Organization (NISO) Alternative Assessment Metrics Initiative is working to define standards and best practices for applying altmetrics to non-traditional products like software and data (http://www. niso.org/topics/tl/altmetrics{\_}initiative/). The Consortia Advancing Standards in Research Administration Information (CASRAI) Dataset Level Metrics Subject Group exists to facilitate communication and support interoperability among the various initiatives and stakeholders (http://casrai.org/standards/ subject-groups/dataset-level-metrics). Here, we present research conducted for Making Data Count (MDC, http://mdc.lagotto.io/), a collaboration between the California Digital Library (CDL), the Public Library of Science (PLOS), and Data Observation Network for Earth (DataONE) to not only define, but implement a practical suite of data metrics.},

abstract = {Data sharing and reuse, while widely accepted as good ideas, have been slow to catch on in any concrete and consistent way. One major hurdle within the scientific community has been the lack of widely accepted standards for citing that data, making it difficult to track usage and measure impact. Within the neuroimaging community, there is a need for a way to not only clearly identify and cite datasets, but also to derive new aggregate sets from multiple sources, while clearly maintaining lines of attribution. This work presents a functional prototype of a system to integrate Digital Object Identifiers (DOI) and a standardized metadata schema into a XNAT-based repository workflow, allowing for identification of data at both the project and image level. These item and source level identifiers allow any newly defined combination of images, from any number of projects, to be tagged with a new group-level DOI that automatically inherits the individual attributes and provenance information of its constituent parts. This system enables the tracking of data reuse, down to the level of individual images. The implementation of this type of data identification system would impact researchers and data creators, data hosting facilities, and data publishers, but the benefit of having widely accepted standards for data identification and attribution would go far towards making data citation practical and advantageous.},

abstract = {In the age of data driven science the re­use of data and the compilation of existing data from monitoring infrastructures has become an integral part of research. For the sake of transparency and reproducibility of research it is crucial to be able to unambiguously identify data that were used as the basis of a publication. Globally unique and resolvable, persistent digital identifiers (PID) for digital data sets are an important tool to achieve this goal enabling unambiguous links between published research results and their underlying data. In addition, this unambiguous identification allows citation of data. Proven and community based examples are the usage of GenBank identifiers in the biological literature or the data citation method by using DOIs (digital object identifiers) already used widely in the scholarly literature. Identification of discrete digital objects is simple and citation can be formatted in analogy to citing literature. The identification of still ongoing, open time series does not seem to fit this pattern. A major prerequisite for the proper use of PIDs within data citations is the persistence of both, identifiers as well as the integrity of the associated data set. This poses questions when PIDs are to be used for unfinished data sets or open time series data. Such data is typically generated within research infrastructures during long lasting experiments such as satellite missions, environmental monitoring campaigns, or in permanent installations such as natural hazard detection and early warning systems (e.g., seismic traces acquired by field stations). Open time series data are often used in research during ongoing experiments and potentially published earlier than the underlying data set has been closed and is publicly released. It is therefore important to enable the scientific community to properly cite these data in their publications. Yet what is the meaning of " persistence " of data in ongoing time series? How does it relate to versioning? What is the granularity of a time series? In this publication we discuss and compare solutions currently used in some major European research infrastructures and propose transparent solutions which allow the citation of time series data using PIDs.},

This strategy eases the tracking of data provided as supplements to articles and papers. Additionally, it allows future data users and the ARM Climate Research Facility to easily locate the exact data used in various articles. Traditionally, DOIs are assigned to individual digital objects (a report or a data table), but for ARM datasets, these DOIs are assigned to an ARM data product. This eliminates the need for creating DOIs for numerous components of the ARM data product, in turn making it easier for users to manage and cite the ARM data with fewer DOIs. In addition, the ARM data infrastructure team, with input from scientific users, developed a citation format and an online data citation generation tool for continuous data streams. This citation format includes DOIs along with additional details such as spatial and temporal information.},

We report on a ten-year study of the Center for Embedded Network Sensing (CENS), a National Science Foundation Science and Technology Center. We found that CENS researchers are willing to share their data, but few are asked to do so, and in only a few domain areas do their funders or journals require them to deposit data. Few repositories exist to accept data in CENS research areas.. Data sharing tends to occur only through interpersonal exchanges. CENS researchers obtain data from repositories, and occasionally from registries and individuals, to provide context, calibration, or other forms of background for their studies. Neither CENS researchers nor those who request access to CENS data appear to use external data for primary research questions or for replication of studies. CENS researchers are willing to share data if they receive credit and retain first rights to publish their results. Practices of releasing, sharing, and reusing of data in CENS reaffirm the gift culture of scholarship, in which goods are bartered between trusted colleagues rather than treated as commodities.},

abstract = {This paper discusses many of the issues associated with formally publishing data in academia, focusing primarily on the structures that need to be put in place for peer review and formal citation of datasets. Data publication is becoming increasingly important to the scientific community, as it will provide a mechanism for those who create data to receive academic credit for their work and will allow the conclusions arising from an analysis to be more readily verifiable, thus promoting transparency in the scientific process. Peer review of data will also provide a mechanism for ensuring the quality of datasets, and we provide suggestions on the types of activities one expects to see in the peer review of data. A simple taxonomy of data publication methodologies is presented and evaluated, and the paper concludes with a discussion of dataset granularity, transience and semantics, along with a recommended human-readable citation syntax.

@article{Austin2016,
abstract = {The industrial and research sectors make significant investments in developing and producing engineering materials. These materials are manufactured and qualified in accordance with a body of product and testing standards that have evolved over many decades to meet ever more demanding requirements. Yet the very significant volume of data that result from these activities remains largely unavailable. While efforts to establish a digital infrastructure for engineering materials data can be traced back more than three decades, widespread adoption of machine-readable formats to enable the routine transfer of engineering materials data has yet to be realized. Given the reliance on electronic systems in all aspects of engineering materials development, manufacture, and qualification, it is an anomaly that simply preserving and transferring engineering materials data remains an issue. This anomaly is accentuated by the fact that in recent years other business domains have benefited from the integration of web technologies into established business models. To address these shortcomings a digital infrastructure is needed that allows and encourages the seamless transfer of engineering materials data between different systems. It is in this context that renewed efforts to develop standard formats for engineering materials data are taking place in the frame of CEN Workshops. While building on prior activities at ASTM and ISO, this work leverages existing product and testing standards with a view to engaging the engineering materials community. With preliminary technical specifications having already been demonstrated to streamline the data transfer process, attention is turning to the long-standing challenge of promoting a culture of data sharing. Whereas previously the motivations for researchers and industrial organizations to share data were lacking, the initial impacts of the DataCite framework for data citation on the utilization of the European Commission materials database hosted at https://odin.jrc.ec.europa.eu are suggestive of a sea-change in data sharing and reuse. This paper describes the status of the work to develop data formats for engineering materials in the frame of CEN Workshops and reports on the added value of data citation beyond simply ensuring that data creators are properly accredited for their work. It also reports the outcome of work to enable the European Commission materials database to support standards compliant data formats and data citation, whereby the barriers to systems integration have been considerably reduced and, irrespective of the level of confidentiality, organizations in both the industrial and research sectors now routinely enable their data sets for citation. Together with recent innovations in digital publishing, a renewed interest in the development of standards for engineering materials data offers new prospects for discovery, exchange, and reuse of engineering materials data. Taken along with other data centric initiatives, such as physics-based and multi-scale modelling, Open Data, and linked data, it can reasonably be argued that standard data formats and data publishing herald a transition towards a digital infrastructure for engineering materials data.},

@article{Cook2016,
abstract = {A requirement of data archives is that data holdings can be easily discovered, accessed, and used. One approach to improving data discovery and access is through data citations coupled with Digital Object Identifiers (DOI). The Oak Ridge National Laboratory Distributed Active Archive Center (ORNL DAAC) since 1998 has issued data citations that have been accepted and used in peer-reviewed journals. Citation elements established by the ORNL DAAC are similar to those used for journal articles (authors, year, product title, and information to locate), and beginning in 2007 included a DOI that is persistent, actionable, specific, and complete. The approach used at the ORNL DAAC also allows for referring to subsets of the data, by including within the citation the temporal and spatial extent, and parameters used. Data citations allow readers to find data and reproduce the results of the research article, and also use those data to test new hypotheses, design new sample collections, or construct or evaluate models. The ORNL DAAC uses a manual method to compile data citations and has developed a database that links research articles and their use of specific ORNL DAAC data products. Automation of the data citation compilation process, as is the case for articles, will enable data citations to become a more common practice. In addition to enhancing discovery and access of the data used in a research article, the citation gives credit to data generators, data centers and their funders, and, through citation indices, determine the scientific impact of a data set.},

abstract = {The two pillars of the modern scientific communication are Data Centers and Research Digital Libraries (RDLs), whose technologies and admin staff support researchers at storing, curating, sharing, and discovering the data and the publications they produce. Being realized to maintain and give access to the results of complementary phases of the scientific research process, such systems are poorly integrated with one another and generally do not rely on the strengths of the other. Today, such a gap hampers achieving the objectives of the modern scientific communication, that is, publishing, interlinking, and discovery of all outcomes of the research process, from the experimental and observational datasets to the final paper. In this work, we envision that instrumental to bridge the gap is the construction of “Scientific Communication Infrastructures”. The main goal of these infrastructures is to facilitate interoperability between Data Centers and RDLs and to provide services that simplify the implementation of the large variety of modern scientific communication patterns.

@article{Goldstein2017,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 The Author(s). Considerable attention has been devoted to the use of persistent identifiers for assets of interest to scientific and other communities alike over the last two decades. Among persistent identifiers, Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs) stand out quite prominently, with approximately 133 million DOIs assigned to various objects as of February 2017. While the assignment of DOIs to objects such as scienti fic publications has been in place for many years, their assignment to Earth science data sets is more recent. Applying persistent identifiers to data setsenables improved tracking of their use and reuse, facilitates the crediting of data producers, and aids reproducibility through associating research with the exact data set(s) used. Maintaining provenance - i.e., tracing back lineage of significant scientific conclusions to the entities (data sets, algorithms, instruments, satellites, etc.) that lead to the conclusions, would be prohibitive without persistent identifiers. This paper provides a brief background on the use of persistent identifiers in general within the US, and DOIs more specifically. We examine their recent use for Earth science data sets, and outline successes and some remaining challenges. Among the challenges, for example, is the ability to conveniently and consistently obtain data citation statistics using the DOIs assigned by organizations that manage data sets.},

abstract = {Evaluation of scientific research is becoming increasingly reliant on publication-based bibliometric indicators, which may result in the devaluation of other scientific activities--such as data curation--that do not necessarily result in the production of scientific publications. This issue may undermine the movement to openly share and cite data sets in scientific publications because researchers are unlikely to devote the effort necessary to curate their research data if they are unlikely to receive credit for doing so. This analysis attempts to demonstrate the bibliometric impact of properly curated and openly accessible data sets by attempting to generate citation counts for three data sets archived at the National Oceanographic Data Center. My findings suggest that all three data sets are highly cited, with estimated citation counts in most cases higher than 99{\%} of all the journal articles published in Oceanography during the same years. I also find that methods of citing and referring to these data sets in scientific publications are highly inconsistent, despite the fact that a formal citation format is suggested for each data set. These findings have important implications for developing a data citation format, encouraging researchers to properly curate their research data, and evaluating the bibliometric impact of individuals and institutions.},

The storage-computing trade-off is now heavily skewed in favor of moving calculations to the data. Provenance metadata help determine a data object's reliability and trustworthiness.Rising atmospheric CO2, the Antarctic ozone hole, and Gulf Stream warm-core rings were all discovered by analyzing long-term datasets. Similar work continues on mapping evapotranspiration and snow water equivalent. In these “fourth paradigm” problems, data (especially data collected operationally) drive hypothesis formation. Making data available requires new discovery mechanisms and policies favoring data sharing. Cloud computing and array-friendly databases will help bring processing to the data.

abstract = {" The impact of Jim Gray's thinking is continuing to get people to think in a new way about how data and software are redefining what it means to do science. " —Bill Gates " I often tell people working in eScience that they aren't in this field because they are visionaries or super-intelligent—it's because they care about science and they are alive now. It is about technology changing the world, and science taking advantage of it, to do more and do better. " —Rhys FRancis, austRalian eReseaRch inFRastRuctuRe council " One of the greatest challenges for 21st-century science is how we respond to this new era of data-intensive science. This is recognized as a new paradigm beyond experimental and theoretical research and computer simulations of natural phenomena—one that requires new tools, techniques, and ways of working. " —DouGlas Kell, univeRsity oF ManchesteR " The contributing authors in this volume have done an extraordinary job of helping to refine an understanding of this new paradigm from a variety of disciplinary perspectives. " —GoRDon Bell, MicRosoFt ReseaRch aBoUT THe FoUrTH ParadiGM This book presents the first broad look at the rapidly emerging field of data-intensive science, with the goal of influencing the worldwide scientific and com-puting research communities and inspiring the next generation of scientists. Increasingly, scientific breakthroughs will be powered by advanced computing capabilities that help researchers manipulate and explore massive datasets. The speed at which any given scientific discipline advances will depend on how well its researchers collaborate with one another, and with technologists, in areas of eScience such as databases, workflow management, visualization, and cloud-computing technologies. This collection of essays expands on the vision of pio-neering computer scientist Jim Gray for a new, fourth paradigm of discovery based on data-intensive science and offers insights into how it can be fully realized.},

abstract = {In this paper we present a new paradigm for the identification of datasets extracted from the Virtual Atomic and Molecular Data Centre (VAMDC) e-science infrastructure. Such identification includes information on the origin and version of the datasets, references associated to individual data in the datasets, as well as timestamps linked to the extraction procedure. This paradigm is described through the modifications of the language used to exchange data within the VAMDC and through the services that will implement those modifications. This new paradigm should enforce traceability of datasets, favor reproducibility of datasets extraction, and facilitate the systematic citation of the authors having originally measured and/or calculated the extracted atomic and molecular data.},

abstract = {International attention to scientific data continues to grow. Opportunities emerge to re-visit long-standing approaches to managing data and to critically examine new capabilities. We describe the cognitive importance of metaphor. We describe several metaphors for managing, sharing, and stewarding data and examine their strengths and weaknesses. We particularly question the applicability of a “publication” approach to making data broadly available. Our preliminary conclusions are that no one metaphor satisfies enough key data system attributes and that multiple metaphors need to co-exist in support of a healthy data ecosystem. We close with proposed research questions and a call for continued discussion.},
