abstract = {TENEX is a new time sharing system implemented on a DEC PDP-10 augmented by special paging hardware developed at BBN. This report specifies a set of goals which are important for any time sharing system. It describes how the TENEX design and implementation achieve these goals. These include specifications for a powerful multiprocess large memory virtual machine, intimate terminal interaction, comprehensive uniform file and I/O capabilities, and clean flexible system structure. Although the implementation described here required some compromise to achieve a system operational within six months of hardware checkout, TENEX has met its major goals and provided reliable service at several sites and through the ARPA network.},

@article{McKusick1984,
abstract = {A reimplementation of the UNIX file system is described. The reimplementation provides substantially higher throughput rates by using more flexible allocation policies that allow better locality of reference and can be adapted to a wide range of peripheral and processor characteristics. The new file system clusters data that is sequentially accessed and provides two block sizes to allow fast access to large files while not wasting large amounts of space for small files. File access rates of up to ten times faster than the traditional UNIX file system are experienced. Long needed enhancements to the pro-grammers' interface are discussed. These include a mechanism to place advisory locks on files, extensions of the name space across file systems, the ability to use long file names, and provisions for administrative control of resource usage.},

Engineering paper, not math, not science.

Target: Build a multiprogramming system. Multiprogramming --{\textgreater} Timeshare

Principles in the approach:
- Feature fix
- Learn from experience
- Loosely couple software and hardware (fix the hardware early in the project)

Why do we want multiprogramming system
- Short response time 
- Economics (multiplexing) of peripherals
- Separate information from its location (allowing to abstract hardware; having software live in a logical world)

What are the architecture paradigms?
- Processes living together in a harmoniously society, where
- A process is a sequential list of instructions

What are the abstractions? (abstractions meaning that something is hidden behind)
- LVL 0: Time (processes have no notion of the actual time) and number of processors are abstracted (hidden). However, there are synchronizations.
- LVL 1: Virtual memory (i.e. segments).
- LVL 2: Message interpreter. 
- LVL 3: Peripherals 
- LVL 4: User programs
- LVL 5: Operator

How to proof correctness?
Proof that the design is correct, then verify that the implementation behaves the same way by pushing the machine to all the "relevant" states.

How is synchronization implemented? (Appendix)
- Semaphores.

What are the two synchronizations:
- Mutual exclusion
- Private exclusion},

abstract = {Another defining moment in the evolution of operating systems Small footprint operating systems, such as those driving the handheld devices that the baby dinosaurs are using on the cover, are just one of the cutting-edge applications you'll find in Silberschatz, Galvin, and Gagne's Operating System Concepts, Seventh Edition. By staying current, remaining relevant, and adapting to emerging course needs, this market-leading text has continued to define the operating systems course. This Seventh Edition not only presents the latest and most relevant systems, it also digs deeper to uncover those fundamental concepts that have remained constant throughout the evolution of today's operation systems. With this strong conceptual foundation in place, students can more easily understand the details related to specific systems. New Adaptations Increased coverage of user perspective in Chapter 1. Increased coverage of OS design throughout. A new chapter on real-time and embedded systems (Chapter 19). A new chapter on multimedia (Chapter 20). Additional coverage of security and protection. Additional coverage of distributed programming. New exercises at the end of each chapter. New programming exercises and projects at the end of each chapter. New student-focused pedagogy and a new two-color design to enhance the learning process.},

abstract = {IIX is a multi-processing and multi-user timesharing operating system. It has become quite popular since its inception in 1969, running on machines of varying processing power from microprocessors to mainframes across different manufacturers' product lines. UNIX provides a great range of programs and services that have made the UNIX system environment popular among users. This environment contains the command interpreter shell, text processing packages, the source code control, a powerful mailing system and many more. The importance of UNIX for manufacturers lies in its philosophy of simplicity and consistency. Since UNIX is written almost totally in a high-level programming language it is very easy to port the system to all kinds of different machines. As a result, by the beginning of 984, there were already about 100 000 UNIX or UNIX-like system installations around the whole world, and the number is still increasing. ?? 1988.},

@article{Rosenblum1992,
abstract = {This paper presents a new technique for disk storage management called a log-structured jile system. A log-structured file system writes all modifications to disk sequentially in a log-like structure, thereby speeding up both file writing and crash recovery. The log is the only structure on disk, it contains indexing information so that files can be read back from the log efficiently. In order to maintain large free areas on disk for fast writing, we divide the log into segments and use a segment cleaner to compress the live information from heavily fragmented segments. We present a series of simulations that demon-strate the efficiency of a simple cleaning policy based on cost and benefit. We have implemented a prototype log-structured file system called Sprite LFS; it outperforms current Unix file systems by an order of magnitude for small-file writes while matching or exceeding Unix perfor-mance for reads and large writes. Even when the overhead for cleaning is included, Sprite LFS can use 70{\%} of the disk bandwidth for writing, whems Unix file systems typi-cally can use only 5-10{\%}.},
